                1
                1 2
                1 2 3       N = 5

6.  Being a very Consumerist Individual, Parambrata receives substantial electricity bills.
    Calculate his bill for a given kWH usage, according to the following rates : 

    0 - 99 kWH : Rs. 250 per kWH
    100 - 199 kWH : Rs. 1000 per kWH plus previous rate brackets
    200 - 499 kWH : Rs. 1500 per kWH plus previous rate brackets
    500 - 999 kWH : Rs. 2000 per kWH plus previous rate brackets

    ALso, GST is charged @ 18% of the total rate mentioned above.

    E.g. : I/P : 550 kWH.

        So, Bill AMount = Rs. ( 99*250 + 100*1000 + 299*1500 + 51*2000 ) * 1.18

    If Parambrata has an electricity bill of 1000 kWH and beyond, print "Urbana Material".

        !!!!        N = 6
        @@@@@
