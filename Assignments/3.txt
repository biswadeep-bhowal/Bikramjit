                                        ASSIGNMENT - 3 : WORKING WITH MATRICES

Note : You can generate matrices using the random funciton in c++

1.  WAP to take u-i/p of a matrix and print it.

2.  WAP to find out the maximum and minimum element in every row, column and diagonal in a given matrix.

3.  WAP to print the sum of every row, column and diagonal of a matrix.

4.  WAP to add, subtract and multiply 2 matrices.

5.  WAP to find siddle point in a matrix. If not present, print so.  

6.  WAP to check the following : 

    (i)     Identity Matrix
    (ii)    Diagonal Matrix
    (iii)   Scalar Matrix
    (iv)    Null Matrix
    (v)     Equality of 2 Matrices
    (vi)    Row and Column Matrix
    (vii)   Symmetrix Matrix
    (viii)  Upper and Lower Triangular Matrix


7.  WAP to calculate Transpose of a matrix.

8.  WAP to calculate Determinant of a 2x2 and a 3x3 matrix.   Note that Determinant of any Identity Matrix is 1.

9.  After a failing courtship with Draupadi's mother, Sumegh decided to leave all earthly pleasures and join the Taliban in Afghanistan.
    Little did he know at the time that his dick would be endangered just to initiate his commitment to Jihad.

    Sumegh is now fleeing Afghanistan. Given a 10x10 Binary Matrix that represents Kabul, help Sumegh escape the country.
    kabul[ 0 ][ 0 ] represents Sumegh's position. kabul[ 9 ][ 9 ] represents the Duran Line which borders Pakistan.
    Help Sumegh reach Pakistan.

    Sumegh can only travel through the 1s in the matrix. The 0s represent Talibanis searching for him.

    If saving Sumegh is impossible, print so.
    If it is possible to save him, print the path he takes and the number of steps required.

10. WAP to swap the second and second-last column of a matrix.
    Do the same for the rows.
